### 🐱‍👤 unsplashLookup 🐱‍👤

## 💻 Build with expo and react-native

## Stack:

- React-native
- Redux

### Why ?

This has been done for an interview, the goal was to build an app in 4h to query unsplash and display the users portfolios.

### Start

- yarn start
- Install expo client on your mobile and scan the QR code from the app.

### Build

- To build the app for iOS or android follow the instructions on expo website https://docs.expo.io/distribution/building-standalone-apps/

### Which I had more time to:

- Add tests
- Add carousel when clicking an image
- Improve styles
- Cleanup code
